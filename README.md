## ✅ AidChain Project Aligns With These SDGs:

**SDG Why It Applies :**
- 🎯 SDG 16 – AidChain uses Ethereum Sepolia and Oasis Sapphire smart contracts for transparent, tamper-proof donation and aid records. This prevents fraud, ensures accountability, and builds trust in institutions.
- 🎯 SDG 17 – Your platform connects donors, NGOs, aid recipients, and developers. By being decentralized and open-source, it fosters cross-border partnerships without relying on a single central authority.
- 🎯 SDG 1 – AidChain enables direct and efficient transfer of funds from donors to approved recipients, reducing intermediaries and ensuring aid reaches those in need faster.
- 🎯 SDG 10 – By allowing anyone with internet access to participate, AidChain removes geographic and institutional barriers to receiving aid, supporting financial inclusion for vulnerable groups.
